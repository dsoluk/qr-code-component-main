## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

For me, the biggest challenge was to get the Flexbox to size correctly with the items. Frankly, not convinced I have it right yet but looks OK. I used %'ages. Once I figured out where to put the display: flex, the sizing worked out better. The issue was with the footer following the end of the flex box but I needed it at the bottom, no matter the size of the flex box (used position: fixed, margin: 0).

### Continued development

Need to spend more time on Flexbox and then Grid.

Got to get faster at this and have less trial and error.
